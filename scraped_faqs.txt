Question: 13. Can I make an advance payment in EmaraTax specifically for a future tax return?
Answer: You can make an advance payment specifically towards your immediate next tax return by choosing the required option under the "Advance Payment" section of the "My Payments" screen. Your immediate next tax return will be displayed in the “Payment towards your next tax return filing” field. This advance payment will be held on account until your immediate next tax return is filed. Any excess amount after the settlement of the said tax return will then be used to settle any other outstanding or future liabilities strictly on the basis of due dates starting with the oldest liability first. Note that, for example, if your tax period is monthly and you file your December return first and then try to make an advance payment, the tax period listed in the "Payment towards your next tax return filing" field would be the subsequent period (i.e. January) and not the one you just filed (i.e. December). Your advance payment would then be held on account till that subsequent period’s return (i.e. January) is filed and will not be allocated to the December tax return that was just filed. The payment for the December return that you have already filed, would need to be made from the “Select and Pay” screen and not as an advance payment. Note that if you wish to make an advance payment via GIBAN, you must first generate a unique payment reference number in EmaraTax.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 14. Where can I enter my payment reference number on my online banking portal.
Answer: This will depend on the banking portal you are using.

Please note that you should only enter the 6 digits of the payment reference number. Please ensure that you do not include any additional text (e.g. "this is my reference number" or "ref #", etc.).

--------------------------------------------------
Question: 47. If I submit a negative delta VD in which I amend my incorrect declaration as a "Qualifying Registrant" for e-commerce purposes, will my VAT returns be updated immediately to cater for e-commerce reporting?
Answer: No. Your submitted negative delta Voluntary Disclosure in which you amended your "Qualifying Registrant" status for e-commerce purposes will have to be first approved by the FTA.

Answer: Yes. In such a scenario, you should submit Voluntary Disclosures to correct all your VAT returns submitted after 01 July 2023 – 31 July 2023 based on normal VAT return reporting and not based on e-commerce reporting.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 50. I am a representative member of a VAT Group and some of the members of my VAT group make e-commerce supplies. What is the threshold for the value of the Taxable Supplies made by the group members through an Electronic Commerce Medium?

Answer: Yes. The "Qualifying Registrant" status will remain with the VAT Group and for the identified “lock-in period” of e-commerce reporting of 18 months or 2 years, even where a VAT group member exits the Group and where that would bring the VAT Group’s cumulative e-commerce supplies below the AED 100 million threshold.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 53. I am a member of a VAT group that is a "Qualifying Registrant" for e-commerce purposes. If I exit the group before the end of the e-commerce reporting period, will I have to continue submitting VAT returns under e-commerce reporting?

--------------------------------------------------
Question: 54. I am a representative member of a VAT group. If I am adding a new member to the VAT group, will EmaraTax notify me if that entity is a "Qualifying Registrant" for e-commerce purposes.

Question: 75. What is VAT?
Answer: Value Added Tax (or VAT) is an indirect tax. Occasionally you might also see it referred to as a type of general consumption tax. In a country which has a VAT, it is imposed on most supplies of goods and services that are bought and sold. VAT is one of the most common types of consumption tax found around the world. Over 150 countries have implemented VAT (or its equivalent, Goods and Services Tax), including all 29 European Union members, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and Malaysia. VAT is charged at each step of the ‘supply chain’. Ultimate consumers generally bear the VAT cost while businesses collect and account for the tax, in a way acting as a tax collector on behalf of the government. A business pays the government the tax that it collects from the customers while it may also receive a refund from the government on tax that it has paid to its suppliers. The net result is that tax receipts to government reflect the ‘value add’ throughout the supply chain.

Answer: Tax is the means by which governments raise revenue to pay for public services.

Question: 92. What is a “Business” or “Business Activity”?
Answer: The terms “Business” and “Business Activity” as defined in the Corporate Tax Law identify when the activities of certain persons give rise to a UAE CT liability by considering the person to be a taxable person. “Business” means any economic activity, whether continuous or short term, conducted by any person. It is implied that a business is conducted with a profit motive, and that there is the existence of some system and organisation to the activity conducted. However, a business or business activity for UAE CT purposes does not lose its identity simply because it does not make a profit. For the application of the Corporate Tax Law to companies and other juridical persons, all activities conducted and assets used or held will generally be considered activities conducted, and assets used or held, for the purposes of a “Business”. Individuals can earn income from wages and salaries, investments or from practising a commercial, industrial or professional activity, either directly or as sole proprietor of a business. For natural persons, a Cabinet Decision will be issued in due course specifying further information on what would bring a natural person within the scope of UAE CT.

Question: 97. How can I download a soft copy of my tax registration / deregistration certificate from EmaraTax?
Answer: In EmaraTax, the registration certificates can be found in the "My Correspondences" section of your Taxable Person account.  All your registration certificates that were available in your eServices account have been migrated to your EmaraTax account. Note that if your tax registration certificate was not available as a pdf document in your dashboard in the old system, then you will not be able to find it in your EmaraTax dashboard.

Question: 148. What is the difference between VAT and Sales Tax?
Answer: A sales tax is also a consumption tax, just like VAT. For the general public there may be no observable difference between how the two types of taxes work, but there are some key differences. In many countries, sales taxes are only imposed on transactions involving goods. In addition, sales tax is only imposed on the final sale to the consumer. This contrasts with VAT which is imposed on goods and services and is charged throughout the supply chain, including on the final sale. VAT is also imposed on imports of goods and services so as to ensure that a level playing field is maintained for domestic providers of those same goods and services. Many countries prefer a VAT over sales taxes for a range of reasons. Importantly, VAT is considered a more sophisticated approach to taxation as it makes businesses serve as tax collectors on behalf of the government and cuts down on misreporting and tax evasion.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 149. Does the owner of real estate have to register for VAT?
Answer: The owners of residential buildings who only make exempt supplies do not have to register for VAT if they do not have any taxable business activities.

The owner of any building that is not residential, will have to register if the value of the supplies over the preceding 12 months exceeds AED 375,000 or it is expected that they will exceed AED 375,000 over the coming 30 days.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 150. When is Excise Tax due?
Answer: Excise Tax is due when goods are ‘released for consumption’ i.e. when they enter free circulation in the UAE. Excise tax is due when: Excise goods are imported into the UAE; Excise goods are released for consumption in the UAE (e.g. manufactured and released from a designated zone/excise warehouse etc); or Excise goods are acquired by a stockpiler, where tax has not previously been paid on these goods. Excise tax is not a transaction-based tax, which means that goods do not need to be sold in order for the tax to be due.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 151. What Global legislation and standards are behind the DTS scheme?
Answer: Tobacco companies are already used to applying track and trace technology for their products.

Question: 152. What kind of records are businesses required to maintain, and for how long?

(7) of 2017 on Federal Tax procedures and the Cabinet Decision No. (36) of 2017 on the Executive Regulation of the Federal Law No. (7) of 2017 on Tax Procedures.

--------------------------------------------------
Question: 167. When EmaraTax goes live, is there a change in how I make a GIBAN payment?
Answer: Yes. You must first pre-select within the system the liabilities that you want to pay and then generate a unique payment reference number for them. The GIBAN, the unique payment reference number and the exact payment amount (linked to that specific reference number) should all be quoted when making your payment. If you are making payment using a UAE based bank/financial institution, and do not include the information listed above, then your payment will not be accepted. If you are making a payment using an overseas bank/financial institution and do not include this information, this could result in the incorrect allocation of your payment.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 168. Which areas can be registered as a designated zone for Excise Tax purposes?
Answer: A designated zone should be a fenced area intended to be a free zone that cannot be entered or exited except through a designated road and any area designated by the FTA as being subject to the supervision of a warehouse keeper.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 169. How will the scheme actually work in practice?
Answer: The FTA will licence all manufacturers, importers and distributors to trade in the UAE. With this licence in place, the importers/ local manufacturers will be able to order tax stamps. Unique tax stamps will be allocated and despatched to the manufacturers, with each stamp having a digital ‘twin’ (a unique code) with the stamp, and the coding being applied on-line to individual packs during the cigarette manufacturing process. Manufacturers will submit the details of stamps and codes used to the central database and retain this information for reporting usage and intended export shipment data to the FTA. The FTA will be informed when batches have cleared customs. Law enforcement will check throughout the supply chain that the tax stamps are in use
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 170. How should a business determine the place of supply?
Answer: The place of supply will determine whether a supply is made within the UAE (in which case the UAE VAT legislation will apply), or outside the UAE for VAT purposes. For a supply of goods, the place of supply should be the location of goods when the supply takes place with special rules for certain categories of supplies (e.g. water and energy, cross border supplies). For the supply of services, the place of supply should generally be where the supplier is established with special rules for certain categories of supplies (e.g. for the supply of catering services, the place of supply shall be where the services are actually performed).

Question: 177. Are refunds of Excise Tax available?
Answer: Unlike VAT, excise tax is paid once in the supply chain and businesses that have purchased excise goods cannot obtain a refund of the excise tax paid on those goods. There are a limited number of cases where a refund of excise tax will be available. Those cases are: When excise tax has been paid on an excise good, which is then produced in to a ‘new’ excise good, on which excise tax is again due; When excise tax has been paid on an excise good that is then exported outside the UAE; or When amounts have been paid to the FTA in error. In the above cases, a business registered for excise tax will be entitled to a refund of the excise tax paid. The refund will be granted by allowing a deduction of the refundable amount from the tax due in the next excise tax return period. There are also a limited number of cases where refunds will be available to people who are not registered for excise tax. Those cases are: Where excise tax has been paid by certain international governments, diplomatic missions and international organisations in the course of their official activities, where a reciprocal agreement is in place between the UAE and the entity’s home country; and Where excise tax has been paid in the UAE by a person who is registered for excise tax in another GCC country that is implementing excise tax and who has then exported the excise goods out of the UAE and paid excise tax in that other GCC country. A refund request form will be available on the FTA website that can be used to request refunds.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 178. When will affected businesses be able to register for DTS/Where can I find registration forms?
Answer: In order to register for DTS, excise registered businesses need to complete a form (visit URL) and send it to the customer care team mailbox to ask for access( ftadtscustomercare@delarue.com ). The Customer Care team will then process the request and provide the importer/manufacturer with relevant and tailored access to the Certify system.  The DTS system for ordering Tax Stamps will go live on 1st Jan 2019.

--------------------------------------------------
Question: 181. Tax Refunds for Tourists Scheme: Who does the tourist need to contact if there is a delay in the refund?

Question: 182. Will UAE entities owned by UAE or GCC nationals be subject to UAE CT?
Answer: Yes – the UAE CT does not differentiate between nationality or residence. Juridical persons that are incorporated or resident in the UAE, or that have a permanent establishment in the UAE, will be subject to UAE CT. This applies irrespective of the residence and nationality of the individual founders or (ultimate) owners of the entity.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 183. Is it mandatory to generate a payment reference number from EmaraTax?
Answer: Whenever you wish to make a payment via GIBAN, you must first select the liabilities in EmaraTax that you wish to make a payment for and select the payment method as GIBAN. EmaraTax will then generate a unique payment reference number for you to use when making payment. The GIBAN, the unique payment reference number and the exact payment amount (linked to that specific reference number) should all be quoted when making payments via a bank or other financial institution. If you are making payment using a UAE based bank/financial institution, and do not include the information listed above, then your payment will not be accepted. If you are making a payment using an overseas bank/financial institution and do not include this information, this could result in the incorrect allocation of your payment.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 184. Why is the UAE implementing VAT?
Answer: The UAE Federal and Emirate governments provide citizens and residents with many different public services – including hospitals, roads, public schools, parks, waste control, and police services. These services are paid for from the government budgets. VAT will provide the UAE with a new source of income which will contribute to the continued provision of high quality public services into the future. It will also help government move towards its vision of reducing dependence on oil and other hydrocarbons as a source of revenue.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 185. Is Excise Tax payable by travellers entering the UAE
Answer: Travellers entering the UAE with excise goods for non-business purposes will not be required to register as an importer of excise goods. Travellers may need to pay the excise tax due on the goods depending on the value of the goods being imported. Where the value of the goods is below the threshold for exemption from Customs Duty as per the Customs Laws, no excise tax is due. Where the value of excise goods exceeds the value of the exemption for Customs Duty purposes, then excise tax will be due on the total value of the goods. Physical payment of excise tax will be required before or at the time of import. Further details on the obligations of travellers or non-registered persons bringing excise goods into the UAE can be found in the Excise Tax Importers User Guide available on the FTA's website.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 186. What is the process of ordering the stamp?
Answer: Stamps will be ordered in the DTS system via a simple login and order management process which will be menu driven. When placed an order will be ratified by the FTA to ensure its veracity and completeness, and this will then trigger direct engagement with the intended recipient of the stamps (the Manufacturer). For an importer to create an order, they need to: Log on to the DLR Certify System. Enter their User Name and Password. Go to the ‘Manage Orders’ Section where they will be able to record key information relating to the order, including the market the order is for (for UAE or Duty Free, the product type (cigarettes initially) and the Product Code. A step by step training manual will be shared in the training session. For any further questions, please contact the Customer Care team at ftadtscustomercare@delarue.com.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 187. How will real estate be treated?
Answer: The VAT treatment of real estate will depend on whether it is a commercial or residential property. Supplies (including sales or leases) of commercial properties will be taxable at the standard VAT rate (i.e 5%). On the other hand, supplies of residential properties will generally be exempt from VAT. This will ensure that VAT would not constitute an irrecoverable cost to persons who buy their own properties. In order to ensure that real estate developers can recover VAT on construction of residential properties, the first supply of residential properties (through sale or lease) within 3 years from their completion will be zero-rated.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 188. Tax Refunds for Tourists Scheme: How much is the refund?
Answer: The refund is 85% of the VAT minus 4.80 AED per Tax Free Tag.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 189. Will foreign companies and other juridical persons be subject to UAE CT?
Answer: Foreign entities that operate in the UAE through a permanent establishment or that are considered resident in the UAE for CT purposes will be subject to UAE CT. Merely earning UAE sourced income would not trigger CT payable or require the foreign entity to register and file for UAE CT.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 190. What if I want to pay a different amount than what the payment reference number was generated for?
Answer: Each unique payment reference number is generated against the specific GIBAN and amount payable. It is not possible to make a payment that is different to the amount for which the unique payment reference number was generated. If you need to pay a different amount you will need to cancel the existing unique payment reference number in EmaraTax and generate a new one. This can be done using the Allocations Pending Payment screen on EmaraTax.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 191. Will there be bad debt relief for excise goods?
Answer: Excise is not a transaction based tax so no relief will be available for suppliers that have sold excise goods to a customer and have not received payment from that customer. Excise tax is due based on the date the goods are released for consumption (i.e. enter free circulation) in the UAE, regardless of whether they are subject to an onward sale.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 192. What is the validity period for the stamps?
Answer: The validity period for stamps as decreed in the legislation is 12 months.

Answer: Yes. The UAE CT is a Federal tax and will therefore apply across all the Emirates.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 196. How long is the payment reference number valid for?
Answer: The payment reference number is valid until the payment is received by the FTA or until you cancel the existing selection of liabilities and the associated payment reference number in EmaraTax.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 197. Why does the UAE need to coordinate VAT implementation with other GCC countries?
Answer: The UAE is part of a group of countries which are closely connected through “The Economic Agreement Between the GCC States” and “The GCC Customs Union”. The GCC group of nations have historically worked together in designing and implementing new public policies as such a collaborative approach is best for the region.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 198. Will excise tax apply to goods released for consumption in a freezone?
Answer: Goods released for consumption in a freezone will be subject to excise tax. This includes any freezone that may also be registered as a designated zone. If goods are held out for retail sale, or intended for consumption within a freezone, excise tax will need to be paid by the importer or producer that ‘released’ the goods.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 199. Are there any limitation of number of stamps that can be ordered?
Answer: There are no limitations in place, however it will be worth noting that stamps are to be delivered in specific Minimum Order Quantities (MOQs) dependent upon the format of supply required: Reels, Sheets, Bundles. The MOQ requirements for each of these formats are as below: Reel 30,000 Stamps (per single reel) Sheets 240 Stamps (per single sheet Bundles 70,000 (per box of bundled stamps

Question: 201. Tax Refunds for Tourists Scheme: If the tourist fails to obtain validation on exit, is there anything they can do?
Answer: The tourist can return to the UAE with the goods and obtain validation on their departure within 3 months from the date of purchase. Goods must not be consumed or partly consumed when requesting validation, and must be available for inspection.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 202. Will I have to pay UAE CT alongside Emirate level taxes?
Answer: Businesses engaged in the extraction of the UAE’s natural resources and in certain non-extractive activities that are subject to Emirate level taxation will be outside the scope of UAE CT, subject to meeting certain conditions. Other businesses may be subject to both Federal CT and Emirate level taxation. Emirate level taxes paid will not be able to be credited against or otherwise reduce the amount of Federal CT payable.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 203. If I have several payments to make, can I generate more than one unique payment reference number at a time?
Answer: You can either generate a separate unique payment reference number for each individual liability or you can choose to generate a unique payment reference number for any combination of liabilities of the same tax type. Please note that you can generate multiple payment reference numbers simultaneously. However, if you have already selected a particular liability and generated a unique payment reference number for making payment, then that same liability cannot be selected as part of any other unique payment reference number unless the originally created reference number is cancelled.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 204. What is the standard rate of VAT in the UAE?
Answer: The standard rate of VAT in the UAE is 5%.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 205. Will samples be subject to excise tax?
Answer: Samples of excise goods that are given away for free will also be subject to excise tax. Excise tax is not a transaction based tax so tax is due on the goods when they are released for consumption (i.e. enter free circulation) in the UAE, regardless of whether or not they are intended for sale.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 206. How do key manufacturers/distributors raise concerns or issues relating to the scheme, or have key questions addressed?
Answer: The FTA and its partner De La Rue are on hand to deal with any on-going issues and questions. A Customer Care team is being established to handle all queries and can be reached at ftadtscustomercare@delarue.com .
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 207. Will there be VAT grouping?
Answer: Businesses that satisfy certain requirements covered under the Legislation (such as being resident in the UAE and being related/associated parties) will be able to register as a VAT group. VAT grouping would generally simplify accounting for VAT.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 208. Tax Refunds for Tourist Scheme: Is there a limit on the number of items that a tourist can claim refund on? (e.g. 10 mobile phones)
Answer: No, however they should be for personal use or gifts. Purchases may be subject to increased checks if it is suspected that these goods are not for personal use.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 209. What is taxable income?
Answer: The taxable income for a Tax Period is the accounting net profit (or loss) of the business, after making adjustments for certain items as defined in the Corporate Tax Law.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 210. Can I still make an overpayment?
Answer: If you are paying using a UAE based bank/financial institution, overpayments will no longer be accepted by the FTA. If you are paying from overseas, we recommend that you do not make an overpayment. Instead, all taxpayers can choose to make an advance payment towards their VAT, Excise Tax and/or other liabilities. Please refer to FAQs on how advance payments are allocated for more information.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 211. How does the government collect VAT?
Answer: Businesses are responsible for carefully documenting their business income and costs and associated VAT charges. Registered businesses and traders charge VAT to all of their customers at the prevailing rate and incur VAT on goods / services that they buy from suppliers. The difference between these sums is reclaimed or paid to the government.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 212. What help will retailers get from Manufacturers, Distributors and the FTA
Answer: It is the responsibility of importers and manufacturers to ensure that the only products supplied into the UAE will be ones that carry tax stamps along with the approved encoding requirement at this time. Law enforcement officers will be checking throughout the supply chain that this is the case.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 213. Will there be bad debt relief?
Answer: VAT registered businesses will be able to reduce their output tax liability by the amount of VAT that relates to bad debt which has been written off by the VAT registered business. The legislation includes the conditions and limitations concerning the use of this relief.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 214. Tax Refunds for Tourist Scheme: Is there a maximum amount the tourist can spend?
Answer: No.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 215. Will UAE CT replace VAT in the UAE?
Answer: No, CT and VAT are two different types of taxes. Both will continue to apply in the UAE.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 216. How are advance payments allocated?
Answer: If you are making an advance payment towards any future liabilities via GIBAN, you must first generate a unique payment reference number in EmaraTax. The advance payment amount will be allocated strictly on the basis of due dates starting with the oldest liability first. You can only make this type of an advance payment after first settling all existing liabilities for that tax type. If you choose to make an advance payment specifically towards your immediate next tax filing via GIBAN, you must first generate a unique payment reference number in EmaraTax. The advance payment amount will be held on account until that return is filed. Any excess amount after allocation towards that return, will then be allocated to any other outstanding or future liabilities for that tax type strictly on the basis of due dates starting with the oldest liability first.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 217. Does VAT apply to all goods and services?
Answer: VAT, as a general consumption tax, is applied at 5% to all transactions of goods and services unless specifically exempt in Article 46 of the Federal Decree-Law No. (8) of 2017 on Value Added Tax or subject to a rate of 0% as per Article 45 of the Federal Decree-Law.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 218. What will happen to retailers who sell tobacco without a tax stamp?
Answer: We expect all cigarettes sold in the UAE from August 1st 2019 to carry a digital tax stamp. There will be a penalty put in place for non-compliance, the details of which will be communicated in due course.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 219. Will there be a profit margin scheme?
Answer: To avoid double taxation where second hand goods are acquired by a registered person from an unregistered person for the purpose of resale, the VAT-registered person will be able to account for VAT on sales of second hand goods with reference to the difference between the purchase price of the goods and the sale price of the goods (that is, the profit margin). The VAT which must be accounted for by the registered person will be included in the profit margin. Further details of the conditions to be met in order to apply this mechanism can be found in the Executive Regulations of the Federal Decree-Law No.(8) of 2017 on Value Added Tax.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 220. Tax Refunds for Tourists Scheme: Should goods be available for inspection at the exit points?
Answer: Yes
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 221. What expenditure will be deductible for the purposes of calculating taxable income?
Answer: In principle, all legitimate business expenses incurred to derive taxable income will be deductible, although the timing of the deduction may vary for different types of expenses and the accounting method applied. For capital assets, expenditure would generally be recognised by way of depreciation or amortisation deductions over the economic life of the asset or benefit. Expenditure that has a dual purpose, such as expenses incurred for both personal and business purposes, will need to be apportioned with the relevant portion of the expenditure treated as incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the taxable person’s business.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 222. Will EmaraTax allow the separation of two taxable accounts that were registered with one email?
Answer: Yes. In EmaraTax, you will have access to link or delink Taxable Person accounts to/from a registered email.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 223. What measures does the government take to ensure that businesses do not use the VAT implementation as an excuse to increase prices?
Answer: VAT is intended to help improve the economic base of the country. Therefore, there are rules that require businesses to be clear about how much VAT you are paying for each transaction. Consumers should have the required information to decide whether to buy something or not.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 224. How will consumers know what to look out for?
Answer: Consumers should look for both the presence of physical stamps and digital codes on the products purchased in within the UAE.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 225. How will partial exemption work?
Answer: Where a VAT registered person incurs input tax on its business expenses, this input tax can be recovered in full if it relates to a taxable supply made, or intended to be made, by the registered person. In contrast, where the expense relates to a non-taxable supply (e.g. exempt supplies), the registered person may not recover the input tax paid. In certain situations, an expense may relate to both taxable and non-taxable supplies made by the registered person (such as activities of the banking sector). In these circumstances, the registered person would need to apportion input tax between the taxable and non-taxable supplies. Businesses will be expected to use input tax (ratio of recoverable input tax to total input tax incurred) as a basis for apportionment in the first instance although there will be the facility to use other methods where they are fair and agreed with the Federal Tax Authority.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 226. Tax Refunds for Tourists Scheme: The tourist has obtained the Tax Free Tag. What are the next steps?
Answer: The tourist must keep the Tax Free Tag attached to the invoice until their day of departure. On departure, the tourist must present their Tax Free Tag to a member of Planet staff or go to a Planet self-serve kiosk to have the Tax Free Tag digitally validated before checking in their luggage and going through security. At the end of the process, the tourist can choose whether they want a credit/debit card or cash refund.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 227. Will I have to pay UAE CT alongside VAT in the UAE?

Question: 228. Where can I find a payment reference number that I had previously created?
Answer: In order to find a payment reference number that you previously created, please click on “My payments” in the menu on the left side of your screen, click on “Select and Pay”, then click on “Allocations pending payment”. You can also download a copy of the payment instruction under the “My Correspondence” section in EmaraTax.

Question: 229. How can one object to the decisions of the Authority?
Answer: Any person is able to object to a decision of the Federal Tax Authority. As a first step, the person shall request the FTA to reconsider its decision. Such request of reconsideration has to be made within 20 business days from the date the person was notified of the original decision of the FTA, and the FTA will have 20 business days from receipt of such application to provide its revised decision. If the person is not satisfied with the revised decision of the FTA, it will be able to object to the Tax Disputes Resolution Committee which will be set up for these purposes. Objections to the Committee will need to be submitted within 20 business days from the date the person was notified of the FTA’s revised decision, and the person must pay all taxes and penalties subject of objection before objecting to the Committee. The Committee will typically be required to give its decision regarding the objection within 20 business days from its receipt. As a final step, if the person is not satisfied with the decision of the Committee, the person may challenge its decision before the competent court. The appeal must be made within 20 business days from the date of the appellant being notified of the Committee’s decision.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 230. What consumers should do in case they find cigarettes pack without codes?
Answer: Consumers should look for both the presence of physical stamps and digital codes on the products purchased. If a consumer believes that a pack of cigarettes is without mark and code, then they should notify the FTA where they purchased the pack from, so the appropriate action can be taken. This is likely to involve action against the retailer, importer and manufacturer but will not impact the consumer. For any Consumer queries, please contact the Customer Care team on ftadtscustomercare@delarue.com
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 231. What are the cases that would lead to the imposition of penalties?
Answer: Penalties will be imposed in cases of non-compliance with tax legislation.

Answer: Yes. Applicable service fees will continue to be payable to the relevant Emirate and Federal Governments. Business set up, licence renewal and other Government fees and charges incurred wholly and exclusively in the ordinary course of business are deductible expenses for UAE CT purposes.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 234. What is my registered email ID with the FTA?

Answer: If you have been allocated a “Provisional TRN” and this has been communicated to you by email, you will receive the Tax Registration Certificate after the FTA has fully reviewed your application.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 241. What are transitional rules?
Answer: There are special rules that deal with various situations that may arise in respect of supplies that span the introduction of VAT. For example: Where a payment is received in respect of a supply of goods before the introduction of VAT but the goods are actually delivered after the introduction of VAT, this means that VAT will have to be charged on such supplies. Likewise, special rules apply with regards to supplies of services spanning the introduction of VAT. Where a contract is concluded prior to the introduction of VAT in respect of a supply which is wholly or partly made after the introduction of VAT, and the contract does not contain clauses relating to the VAT treatment of the supply, then consideration for the supply is treated as inclusive of VAT. There are, however, special provisions that allow suppliers to charge VAT in situations where the recipient is able to recover the VAT even if there is no VAT clause in the contract.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 242. Tax Refunds for Tourists Scheme: What happens if some goods are too large to carry and have to be shipped?
Answer: Goods must be available for inspection at the validation point. The validation point will be before check in, luggage drop-off and security. The goods must be accompanied by the tourist when leaving the UAE so if they are shipped via courier they are not eligible goods under this scheme.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 243. What is withholding tax?
Answer: Withholding tax is a form of Corporate Tax collected at source by the payer on behalf of the recipient of the income. Withholding taxes exist in many tax systems and typically apply to the cross-border payment of dividends, interest, royalties and other types of income.
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Question: 245. How is a mixed-use building (residential and commercial) treated for VAT purposes?
Answer: The rent or sale of a residential part of the building shall be treated as zero-rated or exempt, depending on whether this is a first supply within the first three years of completion of construction or a subsequent supply. The rent or sale of a commercial part of the building shall be treated as subject to VAT at 5%. Tax that cannot be directly attributed to exempt supplies or taxable supplies should be apportioned, and only the portion relating to the taxable supplies (at 0% and 5%) may be recovered
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 246. How will insurance be treated?

Question: 247. Tax Refunds for Tourists Scheme: What happens if the refund cannot be collected at the point of departure because there is no time or there is a long queue?

--------------------------------------------------
Question: 248. Will I need to consider the UAE’s international agreements for UAE CT purposes?
Answer: In-force International agreements (including international agreements for the avoidance of double taxation) to which the UAE is a party should be considered under the UAE CT regime. In case of a conflict between the Corporate Tax Law and an international agreement with respect to the right to tax a certain item of income, the relevant international agreement may limit the application of UAE CT.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 249. Does the launch of EmaraTax have any impact on my tax return submission and filing deadline?
Answer: If you have already submitted a tax return, your EmaraTax account details will provide you with the status of your submission. If you prepared and saved a draft tax return on the old system but did not submit it, the details will be transferred to EmaraTax. You can login and submit the return and/or declaration from EmaraTax. Your tax return filing deadlines are set out in the UAE tax legislation and will not change as a result of the introduction of EmaraTax.

Question: 250. How will financial services be treated?
Answer: Fee based financial services are subject to VAT while margin based products are exempt.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 251. Tax Refunds for Tourist Scheme: What is validation or digital validation?

There may also be additional checks required after security.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: 254. How will Islamic finance be treated?
Answer: Islamic finance products are consistent with the principles of sharia and therefore often operate differently from financial products that are common internationally. To ensure that there are no inconsistencies between the VAT treatment of standard financial services and Islamic finance products, the treatment of Islamic finance products is aligned with the treatment of similar standard financial services.

Question: 263. How will the UAE CT regime apply to partnerships?
Answer: The Corporate Tax Law makes a distinction between unincorporated and incorporated partnerships. “Unincorporated Partnerships” (as defined in the Corporate Tax Law) are essentially a contractual relationship or arrangement between two or more persons, as opposed to being a distinct juridical person separate from their partners / members. Unincorporated partnerships are treated as ‘transparent’ for UAE CT purposes. This means that an unincorporated partnership is not subject to UAE CT in its own right. Instead, each partner is subject to UAE CT on their share of the income from the business conducted through the partnership. Incorporated partnerships include limited liability partnerships, partnerships limited by shares and other types of partnerships where none of the partners have unlimited liability for the partnership’s obligations or other partners' actions. Such partnerships are subject to CT in the same manner as a corporate entity (see section ‘Juridical persons’).

Answer: VAT on expenses that were incurred by a business can be deducted in the following circumstances: The business must be a taxable person. VAT should have been charged correctly (i.e. unduly charged VAT is not recoverable). The business must hold documentation showing the VAT paid (e.g. valid tax invoice).

Question: 272. What is a juridical person?
Answer: A “juridical person” is an entity established or otherwise recognised under the laws and regulations of the UAE, or under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction, that has a legal personality separate from its founders, owners and directors. Examples of UAE domestic juridical persons include a limited liability company, a foundation, an ‘onshore’ trust, a public or private joint stock company, and other entities that have separate legal personality under the applicable UAE ‘mainland’ legislation or Free Zone regulations. UAE branches of a domestic or a foreign juridical person are regarded as an extension of their “parent” or “head office” and, therefore, are not considered separate juridical persons.

Answer: VAT is due on the goods and services purchased from abroad. In case the recipient in the State is a registered person with the Federal Tax Authority for VAT purposes, VAT would be due on that import using a reverse charge mechanism. In case the recipient in the State is a non-registered person for VAT purposes, VAT would need to be paid before the goods are released to the person.

Question: 278. Will the UAE CT regime tax large multinationals at the global minimum tax rate?
Answer: The UAE is a member of the OECD BEPS Inclusive Framework and is committed to addressing the challenges faced by tax jurisdictions internationally. As such, the introduction of a CT regime helps to provide the UAE with a framework to adopt the Pillar Two rules. Until such time as the Pillar Two rules are adopted by the UAE, multinationals will be subject to CT under the regular UAE CT regime. Further information will be released in due course on the implementation of the Pillar Two rules in the UAE.

--------------------------------------------------
Question: 280. How will Government Entities be treated for VAT purposes?
Answer: Supplies made by government entities will typically be subject to VAT. This will ensure that government entities are not unfairly advantaged as compared to private businesses. Certain supplies made by government entities will, however, be excluded from the scope of VAT if they are not in competition with the private sector or where the entity is the sole provider of such supplies. It is likely that certain government entities will be entitled to VAT refunds. For the supplies provided for government entities, the treatment of such supplies shall depend on the same supply and not on the recipient of the supply. Therefore, if the supply is subject to the standard rate, the treatment would remain the same even if it is provided to a government entity.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 281. Will the oil and gas sector and other extractive industries be subject to UAE CT?
Answer: Businesses engaged in the extraction of the UAE’s natural resources and in the non-extractive aspects of the natural resources value chain that are subject to Emirate-level taxation will be outside the scope of the UAE CT regime, subject to certain conditions and safeguards as specified in Article 7 and Article 8 of the Corporate Tax Law, respectively.

Question: 289. Will investment funds be subject to UAE CT?
Answer: Investment funds are commonly organised as limited partnerships (as opposed to corporate entities) to ensure tax neutrality for their investors. This tax neutrality follows from the fact that most countries treat limited partnerships as transparent (‘flow through’) for domestic and international tax purposes, which puts investors in the fund in a similar tax position as if they had invested directly in the underlying assets of the fund. Investment funds that are structured as partnerships, unit trusts and other unincorporated vehicles would generally be treated as fiscally transparent “Unincorporated Partnerships” for the purposes of UAE CT. Investment funds that are structured as corporate entities, including Real Estate Investment Trusts, or partnership funds that apply to be treated as a “Taxable Person” for UAE CT purposes in their own right, can apply to the Federal Tax Authority to be exempt from UAE CT subject to meeting certain requirements.

Question: 295. What are transfer pricing rules?
Answer: Transfer pricing rules seek to ensure that transactions between Related Parties are carried out on arm’s length terms, as if the transaction was carried out between independent parties. To prevent the manipulation of taxable income, various articles in the Corporate Tax Law require that the consideration of transactions with Related Parties and Connected Persons needs to be determined by reference to their “Market Value”.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 296. Where can I view any excess credits available on my account?

--------------------------------------------------
Question: 297. Does the UAE CT regime have withholding tax?
Answer: A 0% withholding tax may apply to certain types of UAE sourced income paid to non-residents.

Withholding tax does not apply to transactions between UAE resident persons.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 298. Why are my outstanding payments not showing up in EmaraTax?

Answer: Natural persons that are engaged in a business or business activity through an unincorporated partnership are individually subject to UAE CT on their share of the income from the unincorporated partnership.

Question: 311. Who is considered resident for UAE CT purposes?
Answer: UAE incorporated companies such as LLCs, PSCs, PJSCs, and other UAE juridical persons will be subject to CT as resident persons. An entity that is incorporated in the UAE will automatically be considered a ‘resident’ person for UAE CT purposes. Equally, an individual who is engaged in a business or business activity in the UAE will also be considered a resident person for UAE CT purposes. A foreign company may be treated as a resident person for UAE CT purposes if it is effectively “managed and controlled” in the UAE. All facts and circumstances must be considered in determining where a company is effectively managed and controlled, but a relevant indicator may include the place where the strategic decisions affecting the business are made.

of important improvements have been made to the way you will access and use our
systems, we are striving to limit the impact on users. We would expect that
most current users will need to spend approximately 3 hours in preparing for
the new system including, updating user account details and watching the
"walk through" videos we have published.
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Question: 322. Is a credit available for foreign tax paid on income that is also subject to UAE CT?

Answer: Taxpayers are required to register before they file their first CT return.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 325. Will my interest expenditure be fully deductible?
Answer: The Corporate Tax Law provides for certain restrictions on the deductibility of interest expenditure to discourage excessive debt ﬁnancing, and to ensure that debt financing used or arising as a result of certain specific intra-group transactions will only be deductible if there is a valid commercial reason for obtaining the loan. General interest deduction limitation rule: Businesses with net interest expenditure above a threshold to be set by the Minister will be allowed to deduct net interest expenditure up to 30% of their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), excluding any exempt income. Any net interest expenditure which exceeds this limit may be carried forward and utilised in the subsequent 10 tax periods. Businesses with net interest expenditure below the threshold to be set by the Minister will not be subject to the general interest deduction limitation rule. The general interest deduction limitation rule will not apply to banks and other finance institutions, insurance providers or individuals. Specific interest deduction limitation rule: Where a loan is obtained from a Related Party and is used to finance income that is exempt from CT, the interest on the Related Party loan will not be deductible unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that the main purpose of obtaining the loan and carrying out the transaction is not to gain a CT advantage.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 326. Who are Related Parties?
Answer: Generally, Related Parties of an individual refer to the individual's relatives as well as companies in which the individual, alone or together with their Related Parties, has a controlling ownership interest (typically 50% or more of shares of the company). Similarly, Related Parties of a company refers to any other companies in which the company, alone or together with their Related Parties, has a controlling ownership interest (typically 50% or more of shares of the company), or that are under greater than 50% common ownership. Further detail on the definition of Related Parties can be found in Article 35 of the Corporate Tax Law.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 327. When will a foreign company be considered a resident person?

--------------------------------------------------
Question: 328. How will foreign partnerships be treated under the Corporate Tax Law?
Answer: For UAE CT purposes, a foreign partnership will generally be considered as an Unincorporated Partnership subject to meeting certain conditions, including that the partnership is not subject to tax in the relevant foreign jurisdiction (see question ‘How will the UAE CT regime apply to partnerships?’ under section Partnerships).
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 329. Who is considered non-resident for UAE CT purposes?

Question: 332. Will the income of foreign branches of a UAE business be subject to UAE CT?
Answer: The income of foreign branches or foreign permanent establishments of a UAE business will be included in the taxable income and UAE CT return of their UAE “head office”, unless the UAE business elects to claim an exemption for its foreign branch profits. This exemption is available for foreign branch profits that have already been subject to tax in the foreign jurisdiction.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 333. Can a foreign individual be subject to UAE CT as a resident person?
Answer: A foreign individual will be subject to UAE CT as a “Resident Person” insofar as he or she is engaged in a business or business activity in the UAE. Being treated as a Resident Person for UAE CT purposes does not automatically mean the foreign individual will be considered resident in the UAE for all other taxes or for the application of a double tax agreement. For individuals, a decision by the Cabinet of Ministers will be issued in due course specifying further information on what would bring a natural person within the charge to Corporate Tax.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 334. What UAE CT adjustments to the financial statements will be required to calculate taxable income?

--------------------------------------------------
Question: 344. For the purpose of benefiting from the CT exemption, are both the investment fund and the fund manager required to be subject to regulatory oversight?
Answer: For the investment fund exemption, either the investment fund or the manager of the fund is required to be subject to regulatory oversight, not both.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 345. What is the UAE CT treatment for any unrealised gains and losses arising from accounting fair value or impairment adjustments?
Answer: Where a business prepares their financial statements on an accruals basis, it has the following options in respect of the UAE CT treatment of unrealised accounting gains and losses: ●Option 1: The taxpayer can elect to recognise gains and losses on a ‘realisation basis’ for UAE CT purposes for all assets and liabilities - that is, any and all unrealised gains would not be taxable (and conversely, any and all unrealised losses would not be deductible) until they are realised; ●Option 2: The taxpayer can elect to recognise gains and losses on a ‘realisation basis’ for UAE CT purposes for assets and liabilities held on capital account only - that is, only unrealised gains and losses in respect of assets and liabilities held on capital account would not be taxable or deductible, respectively, until they are realised. Unrealised gains and losses arising from assets and liabilities held on revenue account, on the other hand, would continue to be included in taxable income on a current basis. Generally, assets and liabilities are considered to be held on capital account when they are not expected to be sold or traded with during the regular course of the business operation.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 346. Will service fees paid to local and Federal Governments be deductible for UAE CT?
Answer: Business set up, licence renewal and other Government fees and charges incurred wholly and exclusively in the ordinary course of business are deductible for CT purposes.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 347. What transfer pricing methodologies can be used to determine the arm's length value?
Answer: Generally, taxpayers are required to apply one or more of the following methodologies to determine the arm’s length values for transfer pricing purposes: 1. The comparable uncontrolled price method. 2. The resale price method. 3. The cost-plus method. 4. The transactional net margin method. 5. The transactional profit split method.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 348. Will charities and other public benefit organisations be subject to UAE CT?

--------------------------------------------------
Question: 350. When will a foreign individual be subject to UAE CT as a non-resident person?
Answer: A foreign individual that does not conduct a taxable business or business activity in the UAE (see question ‘Can a foreign individual be subject to UAE CT as a resident person?’ under section Foreign Persons) would generally not be subject to UAE CT. Merely earning UAE sourced income would not trigger CT payable or require the foreign individual to register and file for UAE CT.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 351. Will an individual’s employment income be subject to UAE CT?
Answer: UAE CT will not apply to an individual’s salary and other employment income (whether received from the public or private sector). Employment may include a continuing service relationship where all or most of the income of the individual is derived from one customer, and the service income is essentially remuneration for the natural person’s labour.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 352. Will UAE holding companies be subject to UAE CT?
Answer: UAE holding companies would be subject to UAE CT (at a 9% CT rate or the 0% Free Zone CT rate), depending on whether the holding company is established in a Free Zone or in the mainland UAE, but dividends and capital gains earned from domestic and foreign shareholdings would generally be exempt from CT, subject to certain conditions.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 353. Could a UAE-based investment manager create a UAE taxable presence for its foreign customers?
Answer: Under the so-called “Investment Manager Exemption”, regulated UAE investment managers can provide discretionary investment / asset management services to foreign funds and customers without creating a permanent establishment for the foreign investors or the foreign investment fund in the UAE, where certain conditions are met.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 354. How do I know if I have a Permanent Establishment in the UAE?
Answer: Generally, a foreign person will have a Permanent Establishment in the UAE if: ● It has a fixed or permanent place in the UAE through which the business of the foreign person is carried on; or ● There is a person who has and habitually exercises an authority to conduct business in the UAE on behalf of the foreign person. A fixed place of business would not be considered a Permanent Establishment if it is used solely to store, display or deliver goods or merchandise belonging to the foreign person or to conduct any activities that are of a preparatory or auxiliary nature. A Permanent Establishment would not arise if the person who has and habitually exercises an authority to conduct business in the UAE on behalf of the foreign person acts as an independent agent. Where relevant, the application of an international agreement should be taken into consideration when determining whether a permanent establishment exists.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 355. What is the realisation principle, and when is income realised for UAE CT purposes?
Answer: As under many other Corporate Tax systems, the UAE CT regime allows taxpayers to apply the realisation principle for determining their taxable income. This means that income will only be taxable, and a deduction would only be able to be taken, if and when a gain or loss is realised. Realisation would happen, for example, when the relevant asset is sold or terminated. Under the realisation principle, the taxable income for each Tax Period would exclude gains and losses in respect of assets or liabilities that are subject to fair value or impairment accounting.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 356. Will Value Added Tax paid be deductible for UAE CT?
Answer: Only irrecoverable input Value Added Tax may be deductible for CT purposes. Otherwise, Value Added Tax charged and Value Added Tax incurred would not impact the calculation of taxable income.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 357. What documentation should be maintained in respect of transfer pricing?
Answer: Businesses will be required to maintain information regarding their transactions with Related Parties and Connected Persons, and certain businesses will be required to submit this information along with their tax return. Businesses that claim small business relief will not have to comply with the transfer pricing documentation rules. Certain businesses may be requested to maintain a master file and a local file.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 358. How will international airlines and shipping companies be taxed?
Answer: Income earned by foreign operators of aircrafts and ships will be exempt from UAE CT in respect of: 1. providing international transportation of passengers, livestock, mail, parcels, merchandise or goods by air or by sea; 2. leasing or chartering aircrafts or ships used in international transportation; or 3. leasing or chartering equipment which are integral to the seaworthiness of ships or the airworthiness of aircrafts used in international transportation. This exemption would only apply where the country of the foreign airline or shipping company would grant a similar exemption to UAE operators of aircrafts and ships.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 359. Will a UAE branch constitute a taxable Permanent Establishment for the foreign business?
Answer: A UAE branch of a foreign business would generally be subject to UAE CT, unless the activities of the branch do not give rise to a permanent establishment in the UAE for CT purposes (see section ‘Foreign persons’).
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 360. How are UAE tax residents subject to UAE CT?
Answer: UAE resident juridical persons will be subject to UAE CT on their income source from both the UAE and from abroad, although certain income earned through foreign subsidiaries and income of foreign branches that is subject to tax in another jurisdiction will generally be exempt from UAE CT. Further details of these exemptions are set out under question ‘Will the income of foreign branches of a UAE business be subject to UAE CT?’ under section Branches and question ‘What is the participation exemption regime?’ under section Income exempt from CT. Where income earned from abroad is not exempt, relief for income taxes paid in the foreign jurisdiction can be taken as a credit against the CT payable in the UAE on the relevant income to prevent double taxation (see section ‘Tax Credits’).
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 361. How do you determine taxable income for UAE CT?
Answer: The taxable income for a Tax Period will be the accounting net profit (or loss) of the business, after making adjustments for certain items specified in the Corporate Tax Law. The accounting net profit (or loss) of a business is the amount reported in its financial statements prepared in accordance with internationally acceptable accounting standards. Adjustments to the accounting net profit (or loss) will need to be made for the following items: 1.	Unrealised gains and losses (subject to the election made regarding the application of the realisation principle); 2.	Exempt income such as qualifying dividends and capital gains; 3.	Income arising on intra-group transfers; 4.	Deductions which are not allowable for tax purposes; 5.	Transactions with Related Parties and Connected Persons; 6.	Transfers of tax losses within the group where      relevant; 7.	Incentives or tax reliefs; and 8.	Any other adjustments as specified by the Minister.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 362. Will self-employed persons (e.g. freelancers) be subject to UAE CT?
Answer: Self-employed persons would only be subject to UAE CT if their activity is a taxable business or business activity as per the Cabinet Decision that will be issued in due course. Even if the self-employed person is considered to be undertaking a taxable business or business activity, no CT would be payable on the first AED 375,000 of net income / profit earned from the activity, and further relief (small business relief) may be available to the self-employed person and other individual entrepreneurs.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 363. Will a sole proprietorship or civil company be treated as a juridical person for CT purposes?
Answer: No, but individuals who conduct business in the UAE through a sole proprietorship or civil company may be subject to CT where a relevant business or business activity is undertaken.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 364. Could the activities of a UAE-based investment manager result in a foreign investment fund / vehicle to be considered resident in the UAE for UAE CT purposes?
Answer: Where the conditions of the Investment Manager Exemption are met, a UAE-based investment manager should not create possible UAE residency for CT purposes for the foreign investment fund / investment vehicle it manages.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 365. What are preparatory or auxiliary activities?
Answer: Preparatory or auxiliary activities are those performed in preparation or in support of more substantive business activities of the foreign entity. Examples of preparatory and auxiliary activities include storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the foreign entity, limited marketing and promotional activities, performing market research and attending seminars or conventions. Where relevant, the application of an international agreement for the avoidance of double taxation should be taken into consideration when determining whether a permanent establishment exists or whether the activities performed are preparatory or auxiliary in nature.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 366. Do taxpayers need to consider whether intra-group loan arrangements are at arm's length?
Answer: Yes. Transfer pricing rules will apply to all transactions with Related Parties and Connected Persons. Therefore, any loan obtained from (or granted to) a Related Party or Connected Person needs to be at arm’s length (e.g. interest rate, duration, etc.).
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 367. How often will UAE businesses need to file a UAE CT return?
Answer: Only one UAE CT return will need to be filed per Tax Period. The CT return will generally be due within 9 months following the end of the Tax Period. No provisional or advance UAE CT filings will be required.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 368. Will the investment in UAE real estate constitute a taxable permanent establishment in the UAE?
Answer: A foreign individual that owns property in the UAE in his or her personal capacity would generally not be subject to UAE CT and related compliance obligations. The investment in UAE real estate by a foreign juridical person may give rise to a taxable permanent establishment where the real estate represents a fixed place of business in the UAE through which the business of the foreign person is wholly or partially carried out. For more information on what would trigger a ‘fixed or permanent place of business’ under the permanent establishment rules, see question ’How do I know if I have a Permanent Establishment in the UAE?’ under section Foreign Persons.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 369. How are capital gains taxed?
Answer: No distinction is made between gains arising from the sale of capital assets and those arising from the sale of non-capital (revenue) assets. Capital gains derived from the disposal of assets are included in annual taxable income in the same manner as other income from the business. Capital gains on the sale of shares may be exempt from corporate income tax, subject to meeting certain conditions (see question ‘Are capital gains exempt from UAE CT?’ under section Income exempt from CT).
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 370. What is a Tax Period?
Answer: Given CT is imposed on an annual basis, it is necessary to specify the “Tax Period”. The Tax Period will normally be the Gregorian calendar year (i.e. from 1 January to 31 December), unless the business applies a different 12-month period for preparing its financial statements.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 371. Will income earned by an individual from bank deposits be subject to UAE CT?
Answer: Interest and other personal investment and savings income earned by an individual in their personal capacity should not be subject to UAE CT.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 372. Can investment holding companies and Special Purpose Vehicles used by an investment fund benefit from an exemption form UAE CT?
Answer: Wholly-owned UAE investment holding companies and other Special Purposes Vehicles used by an investment fund to deploy capital and hold investments can apply to the Federal Tax Authority to benefit from the UAE CT exemption granted to the investment fund.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 373. What determines whether income is sourced from the UAE?
Answer: Income will be considered to be sourced from the UAE, if: ● the income is derived from a UAE resident; ● the income derived is attributed to a Permanent Establishment in the UAE of a non-UAE resident; or ● the income is derived from activities performed, assets located, capital invested, rights used or services performed or benefited from in the UAE. The Corporate Tax Law includes a non-exhaustive list of income that is considered as being sourced in the UAE. A Cabinet Decision may be issued in due course specifying the types of UAE sourced income subject to withholding tax. The UAE withholding tax rate is set at 0%.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 374. Would transactions in a Tax Group need to comply with transfer pricing rules?
Answer: Transactions between members of a Tax Group are eliminated in the consolidation of the Group’s financial results statements and hence do not need to comply with the transfer pricing rules, unless a member of the Tax Group needs to compute its stand-alone Taxable Income for the purposes of utilising Tax Losses incurred before joining the Tax Group or when leaving a Tax Group.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 375. I do not have any income / or my company is dormant, do I have to complete a UAE CT return?
Answer: Taxpayers are required to file a CT return, irrespective of the level of income or the status of the company.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 376. What are the UAE CT rates?
Answer: Taxpayer Applicable CT rate Individuals and juridical persons 0% for taxable income up to and including AED 375,000 (this amount is to be confirmed in a Cabinet Decision) 9% for taxable income exceeding AED 375,000 Qualifying Free Zone Persons (see further information below) 0% on qualifying income 9% on taxable income that does not meet the qualifying income definition
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 377. Will an individual be subject to UAE CT on investment returns?
Answer: UAE and foreign individuals will not be subject to UAE CT on dividends, capital gains and other income earned from owning shares or other securities in their personal capacity.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 378. Will UAE investment income earned by a foreign investor be subject to UAE CT?
Answer: Income from dividends, capital gains, interest, royalties and other investment returns earned by foreign juridical persons or individuals will not be subject to UAE CT, unless such income can be attributed to a permanent establishment in the UAE of the foreign person.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 379. I did not make a profit for the Tax Period, do I have to complete a UAE CT return?
Answer: Taxpayers are required to file a CT return, irrespective of whether they have made a profit or not. Taxpayers with tax losses should ensure they file a CT return in order to ensure that these losses can be used to reduce taxable income of future years.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 380. Will an individual be subject to UAE CT on income from real estate?
Answer: Income earned by an individual from the investment in UAE property in their personal capacity will generally not be subject to UAE CT.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 381. If a business has earned taxable income of AED 1 million, what will be the UAE CT amount payable?
Answer: The CT liability will be calculated as follows: ●	Taxable income of AED 375,000 (amount to be confirmed in a Cabinet Decision) subject to CT at 0%: AED 375,000 x 0% = AED 0 ●	Taxable income exceeding AED 375,000 (amount to be confirmed in a Cabinet Decision) subject to CT at 9%: (AED 1,000,000 - AED 375,000) = AED 625,000 x 9% = AED 56,250 The UAE CT liability for the Tax Period will be AED 0 + AED 56,250 = AED 56,250 The final amount of UAE CT payable can be reduced by available tax credits (see section ‘Tax Credits’ section).
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 382. Can I file one UAE CT return for all the companies I own?
Answer: If the companies meet the requirements to form a Tax Group (see section ‘Tax Groups’) and their application to form a Tax Group is approved, they can file a single UAE CT return covering all the members of the Tax Group. Where companies cannot form a Tax Group, they will each be required to file a UAE CT return on a standalone basis.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 383. Will small businesses be given any UAE CT relief?
Answer: In addition to a 0% CT rate for taxable income up to and including AED 375,000, small businesses with revenue below a certain threshold can claim ‘small business relief’ and be treated as having no taxable income during the relevant Tax Period and may be subject to simplified compliance obligations. To claim small business relief, an election must be made to the FTA.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 384. Will the CT return need to be filed electronically?
Answer: UAE CT returns will need to be filed electronically. Further guidance on this will be provided in due course.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: 387. What is revenue?
Answer: Revenue is the gross amount of income derived in a tax period from sales of inventory and properties, services, royalties, interest, premiums, dividends and any other amounts, before deducting any type of costs or expenditure. In the context of income from sales or services, gross income means gross revenues from sales or services without deducting the cost of goods sold or the cost of services.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 388. How do I pay my UAE CT liability?
Answer: Further guidance on the approved payment methods will be provided in due course.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 389. Will there be a requirement to pay UAE CT in advance?
Answer: No. UAE businesses will not be required to make advance UAE CT payments. The CT liability for a Tax Period will generally be due for payment by the end of the 9th month following the end of the relevant Tax Period.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 390. Are there any consequences for non-compliance under the UAE CT regime?
Answer: Similar to other taxes in the UAE (e.g. VAT), businesses will be subject to penalties for non-compliance with the UAE CT regime. Further information on the UAE CT compliance obligations and applicable penalties will be released in due course.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 391. What is a “Family Foundation”?
Answer: A Family Foundation (as defined in the UAE Corporate Tax Law) is a foundation, trust or similar entity used to protect and manage the assets and wealth of an individual or family. The principal activity of a Family Foundation would generally be to receive, hold, invest, disburse, or otherwise manage funds and assets associated with savings or investment for the interest of individual beneficiaries or to achieve a charitable purpose. Such activities would typically not constitute a “business” or “business activity” for UAE CT purposes if they were undertaken directly by the founder, beneficiary or any other individual.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 392. What income is exempt from UAE CT?
Answer: The following income is exempt from UAE CT: 1. Dividends and other profit distributions received from UAE incorporated or resident legal persons; 2. Dividends and other profit distributions received from a Participating Interest in a foreign juridical person (see further information below); 3. Certain other income (e.g., capital gains, foreign exchange gains / losses and impairment gains or losses) from a Participating Interest (see further information below); 4. Income from a foreign branch or permanent establishment where an election is made to claim the “Foreign Permanent Establishment” exemption; and 5. Income earned by non-residents from the operation or leasing of aircrafts or ships in international transportation where certain conditions are met (see further information below).
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 393. Are all dividends and other profit distributions earned from UAE juridical persons  exempt from UAE CT?
Answer: Domestic dividends and other profit distributions earned from UAE juridical persons are exempt from UAE CT, irrespective of the level of ownership in the UAE juridical person paying the dividend or profit share. This exemption also applies to dividends received from a UAE juridical person  that benefits from a CT exemption or whose profits are subject to the 0% Free Zone CT rate.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 394. Are all dividends and other profit distributions from foreign juridical persons exempt from UAE CT?
Answer: Subject to the participation exemption requirements, dividends and other profit distributions earned from a Participating Interest in a foreign juridical person are exempt from UAE CT. A Participating Interest is a 5% or greater ownership interest in the capital or equity of the foreign juridical person that meets the conditions of the participation exemption regime.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 395. Are capital gains exempt from UAE CT?
Answer: Under the participation exemption regime, capital gains earned from a Participating Interest are exempt from UAE CT. Also, there is relief from CT for capital gains that may arise on intra-group transfers and reorganisation and restructuring transactions. Other capital gains would be treated as ordinary income and subject to CT.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 396. What is the participation exemption regime?
Answer: The background to the participation exemption regime is to prevent double taxation within a group where an underlying group company (that pays the dividend or whose shares are being sold) has already been taxed on its profits. The Corporate Tax Law fully exempts dividends derived from UAE entities, as well as dividends from foreign subsidiaries that qualify as a “Participation”. A Participation is a juridical person in which the UAE shareholder company owns a 5% or greater ownership interest (a “Participating Interest”) for at least 12 months, and that meets the conditions of the participation exemption regime. Similarly, capital gains on the sale of shares in domestic and foreign entities would also be exempt from CT. This exemption is subject to the same minimum ownership threshold, duration and other conditions mentioned above.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 397. Can I benefit from a UAE CT exemption if I own less than a 5% shareholding in a company?
Answer: There can be instances where a UAE business makes a strategic investment in another company that does not result in a 5% or greater ownership interest, or where the percentage ownership in the Participation falls below the 5% ownership threshold because of events outside of the control of the UAE shareholder company. To address such instances and reduce the administrative burden associated with monitoring the continued compliance with the minimum ownership requirement under the participation exemption regime, the Minister may prescribe a certain minimum acquisition cost / value above which the ownership interest in another juridical person is deemed to be a qualifying “Participation”, and the income from this investment can benefit from the participation exemption.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 398. What are “Tax Losses”?
Answer: A loss for CT purposes (“Tax Loss”) would arise when the total deductions a business can claim are greater than the total income that is subject to tax for the relevant Tax Period, resulting in negative taxable income.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 399. Will the UAE CT regime allow prior year tax losses to reduce taxable income?
Answer: Tax losses can, subject to certain conditions, be offset against the taxable income of future periods, up to a maximum of 75% of the taxable income in each of those future periods. Any excess (unused) tax losses can be carried forward and used against taxable income of future Tax Periods indefinitely. Example A taxpayer has taxable income of AED 100,000 and carried forward losses of AED 125,000. It can offset (75% x AED 100,000) = AED 75,000 of its losses carried forward in the relevant Tax Period, reducing its taxable income to AED 25,000. The amount of tax losses available for carry forward to subsequent Tax periods would reduce to AED 50,000 (AED 125,000 - AED 75,000).
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 400. Will a change in ownership of the taxable person restrict the ability to use its tax losses?
Answer: Tax losses can be carried forward without limitation provided the same person or persons continue to own at least 50% of the entity with the losses. Where there is a greater than 50% change in ownership, tax losses may still be carried forward provided there is no major change in the nature or conduct of the entity's business.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 401. Will a group be able to utilise the tax losses of one group company against the taxable income of another group company?
Answer: Tax losses from one UAE group company may be used to offset taxable income of another UAE group company where there is 75% or more common ownership and certain other conditions are met. No tax loss transfers will be allowed from companies that are exempt or that benefit from the 0% Free Zone CT regime.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 402. What are the conditions for the transfer of tax losses within a group?
Answer: The UAE companies must meet the following conditions to transfer an amount of tax losses from one company to another in the same Tax Period: 1. Both companies are UAE resident juridical persons; 2. Either owns 75% or more of the other, or a third party owns 75% or more of both entities and this ownership existed at the start and end of the Tax Period in which the loss was incurred; 3. Neither company is an Exempt Person; 4. Neither company is a Qualifying Free Zone business; and 5. The financial statements must be prepared using the same accounting standards, and using the same financial year.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 403. What UAE CT rates will apply to entities established in a Free Zone?
Answer: Entities established in a Free Zone that meet the conditions to benefit from the Free Zone CT regime (“Qualifying Free Zone Persons”) will be subject to UAE CT at the following rates: ● 0% on Qualifying Income. ● 9% on Taxable Income that does not meet the Qualifying Income definition.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 404. Is the 0% Free Zone CT regime applicable automatically?
Answer: A Qualifying Free Zone Person that meets the relevant conditions will be able to benefit from the 0% Free Zone CT regime automatically. However, a Qualifying Free Zone Person can elect not to apply the Free Zone CT regime, but instead be subject to the regular CT regime and rates.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 405. What is a Qualifying Free Zone Person?
Answer: To be treated as a “Qualifying Free Zone Person”, the Free Zone entity must: 1. Maintain adequate substance in the UAE; 2. Derive “Qualifying Income” as specified in a Cabinet Decision; 3. Comply with transfer pricing rules and maintain the relevant transfer pricing documentation; and 4. Not have made an election to be subject to CT in full.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 406. Will a Free Zone entity be required to register and file a UAE CT return?
Answer: Yes. All Free Zone entities will be required to register and file a CT return, irrespective of whether they are a Qualifying Free Zone Person or not.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 407. Will a different UAE CT treatment apply to entities established in a financial Free Zone?
Answer: No. The UAE CT treatment will be the same for all Free Zone entities.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 408. Will Free Zone entities be subject to the global minimum tax (OECD, BEPS      Pillar 2) rules?
Answer: Qualifying Free Zone entities that are part of a large multinational group are anticipated to be subject to a different CT rate once the Pillar Two rules are embedded into the UAE CT regime.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 409. Will a group of UAE companies be able to form a Tax Group for UAE CT purposes?
Answer: UAE companies can apply to form a Tax Group and be treated as a single taxable person if the UAE parent company (directly or indirectly) holds at least 95% of the share capital and voting rights of each of the companies. Example: Company A owns, 20% of company B, and 100% of Company C. Company C owns 80% of the shares of Company B. Because Company A indirectly owns 100% of the shares of Company B (80% via Company C), it can form a Tax Group with both Company B and Company C. To form a Tax Group, neither the parent company nor any of the subsidiaries can be an exempt person or a Free Zone entity benefitting from the 0% CT rate, and all companies must use the same financial year and prepare their financial statements using the same accounting standards.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 410. Can UAE subsidiaries of a foreign parent company form a Tax Group for UAE CT purposes?
Answer: Being (ultimately) owned by a foreign parent company does not preclude UAE subsidiaries from forming a Tax Group, but the UAE subsidiaries must be held by an intermediary UAE parent company that will be the “parent” of the Tax Group for UAE CT purposes.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 411. Can foreign entities be included in a Tax Group?
Answer: No, unless the foreign entity is managed and controlled in the UAE and considered a UAE resident entity for UAE CT purposes. This is because only UAE resident juridical persons can form or be part of a Tax Group.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 412. Will the 0% CT rate threshold apply to the Tax Group as a whole?
Answer: Yes. The 0% threshold of AED 375,000 (amount to be confirmed in a Cabinet Decision) will apply to the Tax Group as a single taxpayer, irrespective of the number of entities that form part of the Tax Group.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 413. Who will be responsible for the filing of the UAE CT and for payment of the UAE CT due once a Tax Group is formed?
Answer: Once formed, the Tax Group is treated as a single taxable person, with the parent company responsible for the administration and payment of CT on behalf of the group. For the period they are group members, the parent company and each subsidiary will be jointly and severally liable for the UAE CT obligations of the Tax Group. This joint and several liability can be limited to one or more named members of the Tax Group, with approval from the Federal Tax Authority.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 414. Will the Tax Group need to prepare consolidated financial statements?
Answer: Yes. To determine the taxable income of the Tax Group, the parent company will have to consolidate the financial accounts of each subsidiary for the relevant Tax Period, and eliminate transactions between the parent company and each subsidiary group member.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 415. Will there be any relief available for transfers between group companies?
Answer: Yes. Companies that are part of a ‘Qualifying Group’ can transfer assets and liabilities between themselves at their net book value. This means that the transfer can be carried out tax neutrally (i.e. not give rise to a gain or loss for CT purposes).
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 416. What is a Qualifying Group?
Answer: A Qualifying Group exists where all of the following conditions are met: ● The members are juridical persons which are UAE residents or non-resident persons that have a permanent establishment in the UAE; ● Either owns 75% or more of the other, or a third party owns 75% or more of both entities; ● Neither member is an Exempt Person; ● Neither member is a Qualifying Free Zone Person; and ● Members prepare their financial statements using the same accounting standards, and have the same financial year.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 417. Will there be any relief to facilitate mergers, spin-offs and other restructuring transactions?
Answer: Yes. The UAE CT regime allows for legal mergers, business mergers, spin-offs and other transfers and restructuring transactions that meet the conditions specified to be carried out without triggering a gain or loss for CT purposes.

Question: 418. What records should I keep for UAE CT purposes?
Answer: Taxpayers are expected to prepare and maintain financial statements for the purposes of calculating their taxable income, and should maintain all documents and records that support the information in the CT return or in any other filing made with the Authority. Exempt persons are required to maintain all records to support their exempt status.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 419. How long must I keep my records for UAE CT purposes?
Answer: Records and documents should be kept for at least seven years following the end of the relevant Tax Period.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 420. Can I use the consolidated financial statements of the group to prepare the UAE CT return for my UAE business?
Answer: No, unless the group only comprises UAE resident entities that have applied to form a Tax Group. Otherwise, each UAE entity that is subject to CT will need to prepare and maintain stand-alone financial statements for UAE CT purposes.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 421. Will all entities that are subject to UAE CT be required to have audited financial statements?
Answer: No. Only the categories of taxable persons that are listed in a decision issued by the Minister will be required to prepare and maintain audited or certified financial statements.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 422. Will the consolidated financial statements of a Tax Group need to be audited for CT purposes?
Answer: No. Only the categories of taxable persons that are listed in a decision issued by the Minister will be required to prepare and maintain audited or certified financial statements.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 423. Will I need to submit my financial statements to the Federal Tax Authority?
Answer: The Federal Tax Authority may request for the financial statements to be submitted alongside the CT tax return, or for the financial statements to be provided upon request.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 424. What currency do I use for UAE CT purposes?
Answer: A taxpayer’s income, deductions and credits must be measured in the national currency of the UAE (AED), and income derived and expenses incurred in a foreign currency need to be translated into AED. In principle, taxpayers are expected to translate amounts denominated in a foreign currency on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This means that the receipt of income denominated in foreign currency should be translated into AED at the time the income is derived. Similarly, each deductible expenditure denominated in a foreign currency should be translated into AED at the time the expenditure is incurred.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 425. Are Family Foundations subject to UAE CT?
Answer: Foundations and certain types of trusts are independent juridical persons with separate legal personality, and would therefore prima facie be subject to UAE CT in their own right. However, these types of Family Foundations can apply to be treated as transparent “Unincorporated Partnerships” for UAE CT purposes, resulting in the founder/settlor and the beneficiaries of the trust to remain to be seen as owners of the assets held by the trust. This would generally prevent the income of the foundation or trust from attracting UAE CT. Other types of trusts (for example, trusts established in the DIFC or ADGM) are a contractual relationship between two or more persons (e.g., the beneficiary, settlor, and trustee) and do not have separate legal personality. These types of trusts will by default be treated as transparent vehicles for UAE CT purposes.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 426. What exchange rate do I use for UAE CT purposes?
Answer: For UAE CT purposes, all amounts must be converted to AED based on the applicable exchange rate set by the Central Bank of the UAE at the time the foreign currency transaction is to be translated into the national currency, unless the Federal Tax Authority allows the taxpayer to use an exchange rate that more accurately reflects the taxpayer’s income.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: 421. Will all entities that are subject to UAE CT be required to have audited financial statements?
Answer: No. Only the categories of taxable persons that are listed in a decision issued by the Minister will be required to prepare and maintain audited or certified financial statements.
